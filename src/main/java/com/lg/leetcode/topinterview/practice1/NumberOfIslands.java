    /*
     * Given an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
     * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
     * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: grid = [
     *   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
     *   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
     *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     *   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
     * ]
     * Output: 1
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: grid = [
     *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     *   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
     *   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
     * ]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Constraints:
     *  m == grid.length
     *  n == grid[i].length
     *  1 <= m, n <= 300
     *  grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
