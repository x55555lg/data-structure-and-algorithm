    /*
     * Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
     * A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
     *      1.Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by
     *  the sum of the squares of its digits.
     *      2.Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will
     *  stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
     *      3.Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
     *      4.Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: n = 19
     * Output: true
     * Explanation:
     *  1^2 + 9^2 = 82
     *  8^2 + 2^2 = 68
     *  6^2 + 8^2 = 100
     *  1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: n = 2
     * Output: false
     *
     * Constraints:
     *  1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
