     *  Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width
     * of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
     *
     *  Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
     * The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
     *
     * Example:
     * Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
     * Output: 10
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
     * Output: 10
     * Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
     * The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: heights = [2,4]
     * Output: 4
     *
     * Constraints:
     *  1 <= heights.length <= 105
     *  0 <= heights[i] <= 104
