class HouseRobber {

    /*
     *  You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount
     * of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses
     * have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were
     * broken into on the same night.
     *  Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum
     * amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
     *              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
     * Output: 12
     * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
     *              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
     *
     * Constraints:
     *  0 <= nums.length <= 100
     *  0 <= nums[i] <= 400
     *------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * 你是一个职业劫匪，打算抢劫沿街的房屋。每间房子都有一定数量的钱，阻止你抢劫每间房子的唯一限
     * 制是相邻的房子都有连接的安全系统，如果两间相邻的房子在同一天晚上被闯入，它会自动联系警察。
     * 给出一个非负整数列表，代表每间房子的钱数，确定你今晚在不报警的情况下可以抢劫的最大金额。
