    /*
     * Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to
     * the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
     * Example:
     *  Input:  [1,2,3,4]
     *  Output: [24,12,8,6]
     *  Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array
     *              (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
     *
     * Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
     * Follow up:
     * Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as
     * extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
